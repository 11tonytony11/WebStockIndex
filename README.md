# Web Stock Index
This is my very first React+Node.js mini project. This web app allows users to  access easly important data about some companies. The main purpose of the project is to get basic experience with React.js and Node


## Client Side
The client side is responsive web page created using React & TradingView embedded widgets. It allows the user to see key data from PC and mobile in a nice modern looking interface.

## Server Side
A basic Node.js server was created using Express to store and manage all the data regarding the companies.
